Welcome to the AgentSerp API documentation!

This API allows you to search, extract, summarize, rerank, classify, and chat with AI-powered endpoints.

- All endpoints require Bearer authentication.
- See each endpoint page for request/response details and examples.

<Note>
  This documentation is generated from our OpenAPI spec and kept up to date with the latest changes.

## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
