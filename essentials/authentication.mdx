## API Key Authentication

All AgentSerp API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token.

### Obtaining an API Key
- Log in to your AgentSerp dashboard.
- Navigate to the API Keys section.
- Create or copy your API key.

### Using Your API Key
Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://5c75-2001-5a8-6cc-e000-55c0-f0b-9da7-10b0.ngrok-free.app/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "openai"}'
```

### Security Tips
- **Never share your API key publicly.**
- Rotate your API keys regularly.
- If you suspect your key is compromised, revoke it immediately in the dashboard.
